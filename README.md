## Usage

First, the user should open an integrated terminal associated with the Develop folder. Then the user needs to type in the command `node index.js`. This will prompt questions in the terminal. Upon answering all the questions, the user will see a newly-generated README file in the develop folder as well. The following video provides a user-friendly tutorial.
